# Simple Scroll Animate

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/simple-scroll-animate.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/simple-scroll-animate)


A lightweight library that allows you to add animation classes to elements as they appear in the viewport. Make a fancy animation play as you scroll to it.

Under the hood, it simply utilises the Intersection Observer API and applies your CSS classes as you scroll into view.

## üöÄ Getting started

1. Install with npm or yarn
```bash
npm install simple-scroll-animate --save
```

2. Supply the list of HTML elements you are wanting to track in the viewport and animate. 
    ```js
    const scrollAnimator = new ScrollAnimator();
    scrollAnimator.create(document.querySelectorAll(".animate"));
    ```
3. Add `data-animate-class='your-css-class-name'` to your html element. Pass in the CSS class to be applied when the element comes into view. 
    [See the full list of options here.](#configuration)
    ```html
    <div class="animate" data-animate-class="animate-fade-in">
        Fancy fade in animation!
    </div>
    ```
    ```css
    @keyframes fadeIn {
        0% {
            opacity: 0;
        }
        100% {
            opacity: 1;
        }
    }

    .animate-fade-in 
    {
        animation: fadeIn .5s linear both;
    }
    ```
